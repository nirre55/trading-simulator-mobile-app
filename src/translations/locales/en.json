    "description": "The iteration calculator is a tool that allows you to plan a progressive buying strategy on an asset whose price regularly decreases. It calculates the number of purchases needed to reach the final target price.",

    "step1": "1. Enter your total balance available for the strategy.",
    "step2": "2. Specify the initial price and target final price of the asset.",
    "step3": "3. Define the percentage reduction expected at each iteration.",
